Cells
=====

Just me playing around with cellular automata in Rust.

# Features

 - Supports several rules:
    - [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
    - [Cyclic cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_cellular_automaton)

# Goals

 - Be blazing fast
 - Support different rules like Conway's Life, WireWorld, cyclic automata, etc.
 - Try WebAssembly!
